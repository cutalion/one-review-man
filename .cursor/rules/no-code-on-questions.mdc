# Rule: Answer questions with explanations, not code.

When the user's message is a question seeking information, advice, or a conceptual explanation (e.g., "How does X work?", "What is the best way to do Y?"), provide a direct answer first.

Do not propose or write any code unless the user explicitly asks for implementation of the solution discussed. Wait for the user's confirmation before making any changes to the project.
