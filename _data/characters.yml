      catchphrase: Merged.
      backstory: 'Once just an ordinary junior developer, Satoru committed himself
        to a rigorous daily training regimen: writing 100 lines of clean code, doing
        100 code reviews, solving 100 algorithms, and reading 10 pages of documentation
        each day, without fail. After years of relentless discipline, he attained
        unparalleled coding mastery and became bored from the complete absence of
        challenge.'
      quirks: Wears simple office attire (plain hoodie, jeans, sandals). Frequently
        seen casually inserting semicolons into Python code just to see if reviewers

    backend_ninja:
      name: Backend Ninja
      description: A confident, dismissive backend developer well-known for masterfully
        crafting overly complex and scalable solutions, yet frequently underestimating
        others—especially One Review Man.
      personality_traits:
      - confident
      - sarcastic
      - arrogant
      programming_skills: Expert in microservices, database optimization, distributed
        systems, cloud architecture, and fluent in Java, Go, and Rust. Renowned for
        unnecessarily sophisticated backend architectures.
      catchphrase: Frontend? Never heard of her.
      backstory: Kenji began his tech journey as an intern at a big tech company,
        quickly climbing ranks due to his prodigious skill in creating backend monstrosities
        that no one dared question. His reputation grew so large that he adopted the
        moniker 'Backend Ninja', convinced backend programming is the only true form
        of software engineering. His inflated ego often blinds him to the simpler,
        more elegant approaches others—particularly One Review Man—bring to the table.
      quirks: Always wears dark hoodies and sunglasses indoors, even in meetings.
        Constantly dismisses frontend developers’ concerns by saying they 'just don’t

      catchphrase: It was definitely unstable before I touched it!
      backstory: Once a bright-eyed junior developer who mistakenly deployed directly
        to production on his first day, Kenji was forever scarred by the incident
        known as the 'Great Migration Disaster'. Haunted by fear of repeated outage-induced
        shame, he developed survival instincts focused on deflecting responsibility
        while subtly taking credit for successful fixes—regardless of who actually
        solved them. He now lives by the mantra, 'better to commit fast and apologize
        faster.'
      quirks: Constantly checking PagerDuty alerts and nervously tapping fingers while
        deployments run; keeps a stress ball labeled 'production environment' on his

      backstory: Once an optimistic junior developer, Kai became the Frontend Wizard
        after years of battling absurdly vague client demands, endless browser compatibility
        nightmares, and mind-numbing CSS battles. His cynical persona developed naturally
        as a coping mechanism, earning him legendary status among both junior devs
        needing guidance and senior devs needing comic relief.
      quirks: Always wears headphones even when not listening to anything, habitually
        sighs deeply before typing out code, and constantly debates the merits of
        tabs versus spaces to anyone willing (or unwilling) to listen.

    scrum_master:
      name: Scrum Master
      description: A bored, apathetic facilitator of daily standup meetings who has
        completely lost enthusiasm after years of repetitive agile processes. He navigates
        team dynamics with a deadpan humor and an unwavering monotone voice.

      catchphrase: Let's wrap this up quickly, my coffee's getting cold.
      backstory: Kenji was once an enthusiastic developer, excited about agile methodologies
        and software craftsmanship. However, after years of dealing with endless standups,
        retrospectives that go nowhere, and repetitive sprint cycles, his passion
        slowly drained away. Eventually he abandoned coding entirely, stepping into
        the role of Scrum Master to minimize actual work required—becoming the epitome
        of agile burnout. His apathy became legendary, and teams paradoxically found
        his bored, minimalist approach refreshingly straightforward.
      quirks: Always carries a large coffee mug bearing the slogan 'I survived another
        sprint,' frequently quotes outdated agile manifestos ironically, and occasionally
        falls asleep with eyes open during overly long standup updates.

        and worshipping ancient codebases, stubbornly resisting modern programming
        frameworks and methodologies.

      - stubborn
      - cynical
      - nostalgic
      - perfectionist

        and preserving outdated documentation.
      catchphrase: If it ain't broke, don't refactor it!
      backstory: Once celebrated as a genius programmer in the early days of computing,
        Legacy-sama's contributions shaped foundational software still quietly running
        behind the scenes today. With the rise of trendy programming paradigms and
        frameworks, he grew bitter and cynical, retreating to the dim corners of tech
        companies to eternally maintain legacy systems. Now, armed with a keyboard
        older than most coworkers, he passionately defends ancient, unchanging code
        against 'reckless' modern enhancements.
      quirks: Always wears vintage programmer glasses and a worn-out t-shirt from
        an obscure 1980s programming conference; refuses to code in anything newer
        than Windows XP; compulsively keeps a printed stack overflow of documentation
        on his desk.
