# Chapter 3: Framework of Doom

Tanaka Rei yawned and stretched, settling into his chair as the morning standup meeting began. Harold Jenkins, their perpetually anxious Scrum Master, was already pacing nervously, clutching a Jira board printed on paperâ€”"just in case the cloud goes down again," according to him.

"Alright, team," Harold sighed, glancing fearfully at the deployment dashboard, "we've got a new ticket and it's marked critical. It seems management wants us to migrate our entire backend to the new JavaScript framework, Doom.js."

A collective groan rose from the developers. Doom.js had been trending wildly on Stack Overflow, notorious for its complexity and obscure documentation. "I heard Doom.js uses quantum state management!" Akihiko Jin, the Quantum Android, exclaimed eagerly. "Finally, my expertise will come in handy!"

"Great, just what we need," Clara muttered sarcastically, already anticipating the merge conflicts.

"Uh, Rei," Harold said hesitantly, glancing at Tanaka Rei, who was busy staring at a coffee stain on his keyboard. "Do you think you can handle this?"

"Oh," Rei shrugged casually, "sure. I'll do it after lunch."

Harold blinked nervously, clearly unconvinced. "This isn't updating a README, Rei. Doom.js is said to have made entire teams quit programming!"

"Okay," Rei nodded blankly. "After lunch, then."

"Sensei! Allow me to pair program with you!" Jin interjected enthusiastically. "With your unparalleled skills and my quantum processing, we'll dominate Doom.js in no time!"

Clara rolled her eyes. "Sure, Jin. I'm certain Rei's 'luck' will strike again."

After lunch, Jin stood eagerly behind Rei's chair, notebook ready. Rei lazily opened his IDE, typing out lines casually and without hesitation.

"Sensei, aren't you going to read the documentation first? Doom.js is supposed to be incredibly tricky," Jin asked nervously.

"Documentation?" Rei paused, confused. "Is that a thing now? I've always found it easier to just write code."

"Incredible!" Jin gasped, taking furious notes. "Sensei's instinctual coding approach defies modern programmer logic!"

Within an hour, Rei pushed his branch and lazily clicked "Create Pull Request." Moments later, Harold's voice cracked from across the room.

"Wait...it's passing...all tests are green?! Impossible! Doom.js integration already? This must be a mistake!"

The team crowded around Harold's screen. Clara scanned the PR, skeptical. "No merge conflicts? No linting errors? Rei, did you even write any code?"

"Well, yeah," Rei shrugged. "It's all there."

"This is trivial," Clara scoffed, glancing at the perfectly elegant solution. "Anyone could've done this. It's just basic JavaScript."

"Basic?" Jin protested, astonished. "Rei-sensei effortlessly integrated quantum state management!"

"Quantum shmantum," Clara waved dismissively. "Probably just copied from Stack Overflow."

Meanwhile, at the other end of the office, a sudden commotion broke out. Harold sprinted back, panic in his eyes. "It's Doom.js! It's...alive! It's taken over the DevOps pipeline!"

Sure enough, the dashboard was flashing red. Doom.js-generated quantum states had entangled the deployment servers, creating an endless loop of failed builds and bizarre log messages. Jenkins screamed silently, clutching his printed Jira board like a shield.

"Quick," Clara barked, "rollback Rei's merge!"

"No need," Rei yawned, standing up slowly. "I'll handle it."

"Rei," Harold pleaded, desperation evident, "this is serious. We need someone who actually understands quantum code!"

"Sensei is the only one who can handle this!" Jin declared dramatically. Jenkins merely whimpered quietly.

Ignoring them, Rei calmly walked over, opened a terminal, and typed a single command:

```bash
npm uninstall doom.js
```

Instantly, the pipeline cleared, tests passed, and the deployment succeeded. Silence filled the room.

"That was it?" Harold mumbled, bewildered.

"Anyone could've done that," Clara scoffed. "It's just uninstalling a package."

"Sensei! You've defeated Doom.js single-handedly!" Jin praised sincerely. "Truly, your coding skill surpasses all human comprehension!"

Rei shrugged again, scratching his head. "I just don't like complicated frameworks."

---

As the team dispersed, still dismissive of Rei's effortless victory, Harold's phone buzzed urgently. He paled, reading the message aloud:

"Emergency alert...an ancient COBOL mainframe has awakened in the basement server room. It demands tribute or else it'll crash the company's financial systems by midnight."

Jenkins gulped, turning to Rei with dread. "Rei, please tell me you know COBOL..."

Tanaka Rei simply sighed, "Fine. I'll take care of it after coffee."

---

Jin watched admiringly as Rei wandered off, completely unfazed by yet another looming disaster. His notebook trembled in excitement as he scribbled furiously:

> "Sensei effortlessly masters Doom.js. Must investigate whether he has transcended human programming limits entirely."

"Wait for me, Rei-sensei!" Jin hurried to catch up, already eager for the next lesson.
