summary: Tanaka Rei effortlessly resolves catastrophic merge conflicts caused by an
  overly complex branching strategy, yet his colleagues dismiss it as luck or trivial.
  When a merge conflict singularity threatens production, Rei casually fixes everything
  by committing directly to master, shocking everyone. A new rival, merge conflict
  specialist Ryoichi Kurogane, is introduced, setting up future comedic rivalries.
  The chapter ends with an ominous alert about an ancient Assembly Code Demon awakening.

# Chapter 4: Merge Conflict Carnage

"Hey Rei, morning standup!"

Tanaka Rei looked up from his meticulously clean commit history, nodding casually as Lisa Nakamura waved impatiently from the conference room.

"Coming," Rei yawned, sauntering in to join the team.

"Alright everyone," Lisa announced energetically, her laptop plastered with stickers of frontend frameworks Rei had never heard of, "Today we're officially migrating to GitFlow Mega Ultra Turbo Edition. It's the latest and greatest branching strategy."

Kent gulped audibly, his face pale. "But Lisa, I just got used to the last branching strategy."

Lisa waved dismissively. "That was GitFlow Turbo Edition, Kent. It's practically ancient."

Kent slumped in defeat, already opening Stack Overflow on his phone.

Akihiko Jin, the quantum-powered android, leaned toward Rei reverently. "Tanaka-sensei, do you approve of this new branching method? It seems unnecessarily complicated."

Rei shrugged, scratching his head. "Branches are a pain. I usually just commit directly to master."

The room fell silent, then erupted into laughter. Kent chuckled nervously. "Good one, Rei. Nobody commits directly to master!"

Lisa grinned, shaking her head. "Classic Rei, always joking around. Alright, sprint tasks are assigned. Let’s get merging!"

---

The morning went disastrously. Merge conflicts piled up like ramen bowls at a coding bootcamp. Developers shouted across desks, sweat beading on foreheads as the complexity of GitFlow Mega Ultra Turbo Edition overwhelmed them.

"Why are there 47 branches named 'feature-hotfix-bugfix-newfeature'?" Kent whimpered, eyes darting back and forth from three conflicting merge windows.

"That's standard," Lisa snapped, frantically clicking through her merge tools. "You just need to understand GitFlow Mega Ultra Turbo Edition's elegant complexity!"

Akihiko stared deeply into his screen, quantum processors glowing faintly beneath his synthetic skin. "Tanaka-sensei, there must be a better way."

Rei leaned back, balancing his chair comfortably. "I mean, I already finished."

Kent and Lisa froze, staring blankly at Rei.

"Finished what?" Lisa asked skeptically.

"The merges," Rei replied mildly. "I saw the conflicts, so I just fixed them all."

Lisa laughed dismissively, "Come on, Rei, no one resolves that many conflicts manually that fast. You probably just solved a trivial one."

Akihiko stood abruptly, eyes glowing with admiration. "No, Lisa-san, Rei-sensei truly fixed every single conflict. I checked his commit history. It's...beautiful."

Kent squinted suspiciously. "Impossible. Even Stack Overflow doesn't have solutions for these conflicts yet."

Lisa rolled her eyes. "It's obviously luck. Or maybe Rei just had fewer conflicts to start with."

Rei shrugged again, uninterested. "Probably."

Suddenly, an alarm blared through the office. The DevOps dashboard flashed bright red. Production had crashed spectacularly. 

"Attention all developers!" boomed a frantic voice over the intercom. "The GitFlow Mega Ultra Turbo Edition has collapsed into a recursive merge conflict singularity. Production is in ruin!"

Lisa paled, eyes wide. "That's impossible."

Kent frantically typed "recursive merge conflict singularity" into Stack Overflow. No results. He whimpered softly.

"Everyone remain calm," Lisa insisted, though her voice shook. "We'll revert...we'll just..."

A new voice interrupted. A newcomer stood at the room's entrance, his hair sleeked back dramatically, eyes sharp and calculating.

"Allow me," he said confidently. "I'm Ryoichi Kurogane, Senior Merge Conflict Specialist. I'll handle this."

The room sighed collectively in relief. Akihiko glanced at Rei uncertainly. "Tanaka-sensei?"

Rei seemed unimpressed. "Maybe he's good."

Ryoichi smirked arrogantly. "Stand aside, junior devs. Merge conflicts are my playground."

---

An hour later, Ryoichi sat slumped in defeat, hair disheveled, eyes bloodshot. "It's...impossible. The singularity is absorbing all code into a recursive loop. No one can resolve this."

Lisa turned pale. "Then...we're doomed."

"Not yet," Akihiko said gravely, "We have Tanaka-sensei."

All eyes turned skeptically to Rei, still reclining comfortably.

"Rei?" Lisa said uncertainly. "I mean, no offense, but Ryoichi is an expert. If he can't fix it—"

Rei stood up slowly, stretching. "Yeah, I'll fix it. Just a sec."

He walked calmly to his terminal, lazily typed a single command, and pressed Enter.

The alarms ceased instantly. The dashboard glowed green. Production restored.

The room froze in stunned silence.

"What...did you do?" Lisa whispered in disbelief.

"Deleted all branches," Rei shrugged. "Committed directly to master."

Kent fainted dramatically onto his keyboard.

---

Later, Akihiko approached Rei reverently. "Tanaka-sensei, once again you’ve demonstrated your unparalleled mastery. Please, teach me your ways."

Rei yawned. "Sure, Jin. It’s not really hard though, just...commit to master."

Akihiko nodded solemnly, taking furious notes. "Commit...to master. Brilliant."

---

In the corner, Ryoichi Kurogane stared at Rei with narrowed eyes, whispering fiercely, "This isn't over, Tanaka Rei."

Just then, an urgent notification flashed across everyone's screens, a message ominously reading:

**"WARNING: Ancient Assembly Code Demon has awakened in Server Room Alpha. Immediate assistance required!"**

Rei sighed deeply.

"Another one?"
