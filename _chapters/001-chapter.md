summary: Chapter 1 introduces Shirogane (One Review Man), a programmer who effortlessly
  solves impossible problems but is constantly underestimated by colleagues who attribute
  his successes to luck. His disciple Hayato (AI-Enhanced Disciple) reveres him but
  struggles to emulate his perfection. The chapter ends with a discovery of a dangerous
  legacy codebase, setting up the next comedic scenario.

# Chapter 1: The Programmer Who Became Too Strong

The daily standup meeting at CodePunch Inc. was as riveting as always—which is to say, not at all. Developers stood in a circle, eyes glazed, each praying the Scrum Master wouldn't ask about yesterday's vague commitments.

"And you, One Review Man-san?" the Scrum Master asked with a yawn. "Progress on your tasks?"

"Oh, I finished all my tickets," said One Review Man casually, scratching his bald head with a bored expression. "Deployed to production, fixed the database deadlock issue, optimized queries, refactored the authentication service, and resolved the merge conflicts from DevOps-san’s latest pipeline disaster."

An awkward silence descended. The Scrum Master blinked twice. "Right, uh…well, those were probably just trivial issues anyway. Good work, I guess."

"Yeah," nodded Backend Ninja dismissively, "he always picks the easy tickets."

One Review Man sighed quietly. It wasn't his fault that problems which took others days to debug took him only a few minutes. He wasn't even trying anymore—just reflexively writing perfect code, merging pull requests without a single comment, and deploying straight to production. It had become routine. Predictable. Boring.

The door burst open suddenly, and the AI-Enhanced Disciple dashed inside. His elaborate cybernetic implants blinked frantically, and his augmented eyes glowed with urgency.

"Sensei!—uh, I mean—One Review Man-san! A catastrophic bug has appeared in production! The entire payment system is frozen, and nobody can figure out why!"

"Sounds like Tuesday," muttered Frontend Wizard sarcastically. "Did you try restarting the server?"

"Of course! But it didn't—"

"Maybe ask DevOps-san," the Scrum Master interrupted absently. "He's usually good at fixing stuff like that."

DevOps-san, visibly sweating, shook his head nervously. "I…already tried everything. Even my emergency rollback scripts failed."

"Hmm," said One Review Man with a bored sigh. "I guess I'll take a look."

"You?" snorted Backend Ninja. "No offense, One Review Man-san, but this is a real issue, not your usual baby tickets."

Ignoring the skeptical murmurs, One Review Man ambled toward his workstation, Disciple-kun trailing anxiously behind.

As soon as they were out of earshot, the Disciple whispered reverently, "Sensei—Shirogane-sensei—why do you let them underestimate you like this? Your mastery of code is unparalleled!"

"Relax, Hayato," Shirogane replied calmly, sitting down at his terminal and logging into production. "I just don't care what they think."

"But sensei, they attribute your flawless coding to sheer luck or triviality! Surely, their disrespect must bother you!"

"Not really," Shirogane shrugged. "It's less work for me to pretend I'm just lucky. Besides, coding stopped being fun a long time ago."

Hayato's neurointerface flashed anxiously. "Sensei, I have analyzed the logs extensively. The stack traces are incomprehensible, the memory dumps chaotic—it's unlike anything I've encountered."

Shirogane opened the codebase, skimmed it lazily for a moment, then typed a single line of code. The system instantly stabilized. Error alerts vanished from monitors around the office.

Hayato gasped in awe. "Sensei! You solved it in one line! Again! How…how did you know exactly what to do?"

Shirogane leaned back, yawning. "It just seemed obvious."

From across the room, DevOps-san shouted triumphantly, "I fixed it! It was probably just a delayed script or something."

"Great job, DevOps-san!" cheered Backend Ninja. "I knew you could handle the tough stuff."

Hayato's cybernetic fists clenched. "Sensei, they're crediting someone else again. Why don't you show them your commit history?"

"Too much hassle," Shirogane said nonchalantly. "Besides, recognition is overrated."

The Disciple's augmented eyes sparked with determination. "Shirogane-sensei, please let me formally apprentice under you! Teach me your flawless coding technique!"

"You already asked me that yesterday. And last week."

"I must learn your secrets! My AI-enhanced algorithms and neurointerfaces aren't enough to replicate your perfection!"

"There's no secret," Shirogane said wearily, standing up. "Just practice basics."

"Basics?" Hayato whispered incredulously, watching his master stroll away.

Back at the standup circle, the Scrum Master glanced at his phone and cleared his throat. "Looks like the production issue resolved itself. Anyway—good job, team! Especially DevOps-san."

DevOps-san gave an awkward thumbs-up. "Yeah, probably just luck."

"Totally," agreed Backend Ninja, glancing suspiciously at One Review Man. "Luck."

Before anyone could respond, the Product Manager dramatically stormed into the room, holding a massive binder labeled LEGACY SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION.

"Attention, everyone! We just discovered an ancient legacy codebase from 15 years ago, still running core business logic—and nobody has touched it since! It threatens the entire infrastructure!"

A hushed, terrified silence filled the room.

"We need our best programmers on this immediately," the Product Manager declared. "Backend Ninja-san! DevOps-san! Frontend Wizard-san! AI-Enhanced Disciple-kun!"

"What about One Review Man-san?" asked Hayato eagerly.

"Him?" The Product Manager glanced dismissively at Shirogane, who was idly scratching his head. "This isn't a trivial matter. We need real, hardcore programmers."

Shirogane shrugged again, inwardly sighing. Another boring day at CodePunch Inc.

_Hopefully, something truly challenging would appear soon._
