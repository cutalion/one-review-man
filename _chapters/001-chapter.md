summary: Chapter 1 introduces Tanaka Rei, an unassuming yet superhumanly gifted programmer
  whose flawless code merges are constantly dismissed by his colleagues as trivial
  or lucky. Amidst a critical deployment disaster, Rei effortlessly fixes the issue,
  again unnoticed. Akihiko Jin, a quantum-powered android seeking programming mastery,
  recognizes Rei's true abilities and becomes his eager disciple, calling him 'sensei.'
  The chapter ends with the awakening of an ancient, formidable legacy codebase, hinting
  at challenges ahead.

# Chapter 1: The Programmer Who Became Too Good

"Alright, team, let's wrap up standup quickly today," sighed the Scrum Master, Harold Jenkins, who was already eyeing the clock as if it owed him money. "Remember, we're deploying the Big Feature™ today. I don't want a repeat of the 'Infinite Loop Incident.'"

The developers exchanged weary glances. The 'Infinite Loop Incident' was a legendary cautionary tale—a junior dev had accidentally pushed code that ground production to a halt for three hours. HR had to send out stress balls afterward, branded with the words "Keep Calm and Refactor."

"First up, Kent?" Harold prompted.

Kent adjusted his glasses nervously. "Uh, still stuck on that bug where the payment gateway randomly denies transactions because the moon is in retrograde or something."

"Did you check Stack Overflow?" Harold asked tiredly.

"Yes," Kent sighed. "I even checked Reddit."

"Well, keep at it. Next, Clara?"

"Merge conflict hell," Clara said bluntly. "Someone decided to rewrite half of the codebase without warning overnight."

"It was necessary." A soft, unimpressive voice cut through the grumbling. Everyone turned to the corner cubicle, where a slightly balding programmer sat staring blankly at his screen. Tanaka Rei was dressed casually, his hoodie proclaiming, "99 Little Bugs in the Code... Take one down, patch it around, 127 Little Bugs in the Code."

"Rei," Harold sighed dramatically. "Did you rewrite the billing module again?"

"It was inefficient," Rei said simply. "Now it isn't."

"Guys, let's try to communicate next time," Harold said, massaging his temples. "Rei, just remember to submit your pull requests—"

"I already did," Rei interrupted. "It was merged an hour ago."

Silence fell over the standup. Merging a critical module rewrite without comment or feedback was unheard of. It was... unnatural.

"Must have been a simple change," Clara muttered, dismissing it. "Probably just removing comments or something trivial."

Rei shrugged, unconcerned, and went back to staring at his monitor, which displayed a single blinking cursor on a blank screen.

Later that day, panic erupted.

"PRODUCTION IS DOWN!" shouted Kent, sprinting into the development area. "The Big Feature™ deployment caused cascading database failures!"

"Wasn't that your ticket, Kent?" Clara asked pointedly.

"Yes! But the payment gateway bug was never resolved!"

"Relax, everyone," Harold said, sweating profusely. "We'll just roll back—"

"Rollback is failing," Kent whispered, his face pale. "Our DevOps pipelines are completely jammed."

"We need someone who understands the billing module," Clara said frantically. Everyone's eyes drifted toward Rei, who appeared to be playing solitaire.

"Rei," Harold said slowly, "can you... take a look?"

"I already pushed a fix," Rei said, barely glancing up.

"When?!" Kent gasped.

"Just now."

"But—but—the build pipeline—"

"Passed," Rei said calmly. "Already in production."

Kent checked frantically. "He's right. It's...fixed."

"Must have been a fluke," Clara mumbled. "Probably luck."

"Or he just googled the answer," Kent added.

Rei sighed quietly. It was always like this. No one believed he actually knew what he was doing. He missed the days when coding was challenging. Now, every bug, every impossible merge conflict, every nightmare deployment was trivial. He was bored.

That evening, an unexpected visitor arrived—an impeccably dressed individual with perfectly symmetrical features and a faint mechanical whirring noise emanating softly from within. He approached Rei's cubicle respectfully.

"Tanaka Rei-sensei," the newcomer said solemnly, "I have observed your commits. Your code is flawless. I am Akihiko Jin, designated the Quantum Android. Please accept me as your disciple."

Rei blinked slowly. "Disciple?"

"Yes," Jin said earnestly. "I must learn to achieve code perfection like you."

"It's really... not that impressive," Rei mumbled. "Anyone could—"

"Impossible," Jin interrupted firmly. "You are the only one who has achieved zero-comment merges consistently. Teach me, sensei."

Rei sighed again, closing solitaire. "Fine, Jin. But don't complain if you get bored."

"Bored?" Jin tilted his head in confusion. "Mastering perfect code is the ultimate goal."

"Trust me," Rei said wearily, "it's overrated."

As Jin fervently began taking notes, Rei wondered if perhaps he had made a mistake. But at least now, he had someone who took him seriously—even if that someone was an overly polite android.

---

Across the office, Harold was explaining to Clara and Kent.

"Did you hear? Rei got an intern or something."

"Poor kid," Clara replied sympathetically. "He'll probably learn nothing useful. Rei's code is always ridiculously simple."

"Yeah," Kent agreed. "Honestly, anyone could probably do what Rei does."

They nodded sagely, completely unaware of the quantum-powered android eagerly absorbing Rei's teachings in the next cubicle.

---

Meanwhile, deep within the code repository, an ancient, forgotten module stirred. Legacy code, untouched since the dawn of the startup, was about to awaken—and it would challenge even the mightiest developer.

Even Rei.

"Sensei," Jin said, raising his eyes from the monitor, "I sense a great disturbance in the codebase."

Rei didn't look up. "Probably just more tech debt."

Jin narrowed his eyes. "No, sensei. It's something... older."

Rei finally turned, eyebrow slightly raised. "Older?"

Jin nodded solemnly. "Legacy."

Rei leaned back, intrigued for the first time in months. Perhaps coding could still surprise him.

Perhaps he wouldn't be bored tomorrow.

"Interesting," Rei murmured softly.
