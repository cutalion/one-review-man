# Chapter 1: The Programmer Nobody Knows

"Alright everyone, let's start our daily standup," murmured Scrum Master Sato, eyes glued to the Jira board. "Remember, brevity. Yesterday’s achievements, today's goals, blockers—nothing else."

The conference room filled with tired groans, coffee slurps, and the gentle hum of laptops booting up. Standing in the corner, leaning casually against the wall, stood a plainly dressed man with slightly messy black hair and a hoodie that read, "Debugging: Being the detective in a crime movie where you're also the murderer."

"One Review Man-san," called out Sato flatly, adjusting his glasses. "You go first."

"Oh," One Review Man replied, scratching his head lazily. "Yesterday I finished the AI-driven analytics engine rewrite, fixed the memory leak in the legacy codebase, and optimized the database queries to reduce response time by 300%. Today I was thinking about updating the CI/CD pipeline to auto-scale deployments. No blockers."

Silence filled the room for a brief moment, only interrupted by someone dropping a pen. Then laughter erupted.

"Haha, good one, One Review Man-san!" chuckled Frontend Developer Tanaka, wiping tears from his eyes. "But seriously, what did you actually accomplish yesterday?"

One Review Man shrugged nonchalantly. "That's exactly what I did."

"Sure, sure," smirked Tanaka. "I bet it was just some lucky Stack Overflow copy-paste."

The room laughed again. One Review Man shrugged once more, indifferent.

Standing behind him, eyes glowing faintly blue with augmented reality overlays, stood the AI-Enhanced Disciple, Genki. His face was intense with admiration and determination as he scribbled furiously into his digital notebook, mumbling, "Incredible efficiency... no wasted keystrokes... such mastery. I must document every detail."

"AI-Enhanced Disciple," called Sato, snapping Genki out of his trance. "Your turn."

"Yes, Scrum Master! Yesterday, I attempted to implement the predictive caching algorithm using my neural interface enhancements. However, I encountered severe merge conflicts, dependency hell, and eventually triggered a catastrophic infinite loop that nearly melted the QA server."

"Again?" groaned Sato, pinching his nose bridge. "Disciple-kun, please be careful."

"Of course! Today, I humbly request permission to pair program with One Review Man-san. I'm confident observing his technique firsthand will drastically improve my efficiency!"

"Really?" whispered Tanaka skeptically. "You want to pair with the guy who does nothing but trivial tasks?"

"Not trivial!" the Disciple protested passionately. "One Review Man-san's coding skills are unmatched!"

"Calm down, Disciple-kun," sighed Sato. "Fine, go ahead—but don't distract him too much."

Later that afternoon, One Review Man sat casually in front of his workstation, his IDE screen filled with perfectly formatted, error-free code. Genki hovered anxiously beside him, eyes wide with awe.

"Sensei," he whispered reverently, "How do you always write such flawless code on the first attempt?"

One Review Man took a lazy sip of his canned coffee, yawning slightly. "I dunno, Disciple. I just type until the compiler stops complaining."

"Such humility," gasped Genki, jotting down notes rapidly. "Even now, you teach me valuable lessons."

"If you say so, Genki."

Suddenly, alarms blared from every workstation. Red alerts flashed across screens. Panicked cries filled the open office.

"Production is down!" shouted Backend Lead Haruto, sweating profusely. "The main server is returning 503 errors!"

"Impossible!" gasped Tanaka. "We just deployed a minor update!"

"Minor update?" snapped Haruto. "You pushed legacy code written in COBOL from the 1980s! It's destroying everything!"

"But the framework evangelist on Stack Overflow said it would be backward compatible!" Tanaka protested, pale-faced.

"Never trust those evangelists!" Haruto yelled.

One Review Man sighed and stood up slowly. "Want me to take a look?"

"You?" Haruto glanced dismissively. "This isn't some simple CRUD app. This is legacy code from before you were even born."

"Exactly!" chimed Tanaka. "Better leave this to the veterans, One Review Man-san."

"Sensei," whispered Genki desperately, "they don't understand your greatness!"

"It's fine," One Review Man shrugged. "I'm bored anyway."

He casually walked to his workstation, opened his IDE, and typed calmly for exactly 42 seconds. With a single tap, he pushed the fix directly to production.

The alarms ceased immediately. Green status indicators returned. Haruto stared at the monitors in disbelief.

"Hey," whispered Tanaka, stunned. "Did the issue just... resolve itself?"

"Must have been a fluke," muttered Haruto. "Probably just luck."

"Luck?" yelled Genki, fists clenched. "It was One Review Man-san! He fixed it effortlessly!"

"Impossible," scoffed Haruto. "Nobody could fix COBOL that fast."

"But he did!"

One Review Man had already returned to his desk, yawning and resuming his coffee. The entire office returned to normal, nobody acknowledging his heroics.

Genki approached quietly, bowing deeply. "You're truly remarkable, {ONE_REVIEW_MAN_REAL_NAME}-sensei."

"Thanks, Genki," replied One Review Man with a casual wave. "But it's just another boring day."

At that moment, a new email appeared on everyone's screen:

**"URGENT: Codebase Archaeology Alert! An ancient, undocumented legacy system has been discovered running critical operations. Immediate attention required."**

The office erupted again in chaos.

One Review Man glanced at the email and sighed.

"Maybe this time it'll be interesting."

Genki's eyes sparkled, ready to document the inevitable brilliance of his sensei once more.

"I believe in you, {ONE_REVIEW_MAN_REAL_NAME}-sensei," he whispered passionately.

One Review Man just shrugged.

"We'll see."
