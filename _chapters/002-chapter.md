# Chapter 2: When Technology Fails

Monday morning arrived at TechHero Inc., and with it, chaos.

The Senior Engineer rubbed his temples, surveying the panicked developers frantically running around the open-plan office. Monitors flashed red, Slack notifications blared, and the production dashboard looked ominously like a Christmas tree gone terribly wrong.

"What's happening?" he demanded, grabbing a passing junior developer by the arm.

"Senior Engineer-san! The deployment pipeline... it collapsed! We have merge conflicts, dependency hell, and someone accidentally pushed to master! It’s a disaster!"

"Impossible," muttered the Senior Engineer, squinting suspiciously. "Such a perfect storm of incompetence could only mean one thing—"

"Technical debt?" the junior developer offered nervously.

"No." The Senior Engineer’s eyes narrowed dramatically. "Sabotage."

Across the room, unaffected by the pandemonium, One Review Man calmly sipped his coffee, eyes half-open in boredom. His AI-Enhanced Disciple, Genki, stood nervously beside his mentor, eyes glowing faintly blue from his neurointerface implants.

"Satoru-sensei," Genki whispered urgently, "Aren't we going to help them? The entire system is collapsing."

"Hmm? Oh, Genki," Satoru yawned, stretching lazily. "It's Monday. There's always a production crisis on Monday."

"But, Master, this seems different. Even my AI diagnostics can't pinpoint the source of the bugs."

One Review Man eyed him skeptically. "Seriously? You updated your drivers, right?"

Genki's face went pale. "Drivers...?"

Before he could answer, the Senior Engineer hurried over, bowing respectfully. "One Review Man-san! We need your help immediately! The pipeline is broken, and the errors are multiplying exponentially!"

"Have you tried turning it off and on again?" One Review Man asked, uninterested.

"Of course! We even tried rolling back, but the commit history looks like spaghetti code now!"

One Review Man sighed. "Fine. I'll look."

He walked casually towards the central computer, developers parting before him like the Red Sea. Genki watched in awe as his mentor opened the terminal and scanned the logs effortlessly, fingers dancing gracefully over the keyboard.

"Incredible," whispered Genki. "Such flawless debugging technique."

"Hmm," One Review Man murmured. "Who merged branch 'ultra_feature_x'?"

From the crowd, a terrified voice squeaked: "I... I did!"

"And who approved the review?"

Silence.

"Wait," he blinked. "There was no review?"

Gasps echoed across the room. "Impossible!"

The Senior Engineer fell dramatically to one knee. "A pull request... merged without review?! Our sacred rituals violated?!"

"It was an accident!" the guilty developer wailed. "I thought it was just documentation!"

"Fool," the Senior Engineer scolded. "No PR is safe without the blessing of One Review Man-san."

One Review Man shrugged, expression flat. "Whatever. I'll fix it."

In seconds, he reverted the merge, sanitized the commit history, resolved all conflicts with a single command, and pushed directly to production. Immediately, the dashboard returned to a soothing green hue. Applause erupted, drowning out the earlier panic.

"Another flawless rescue!" cheered a junior dev. "As expected of One Review Man-san!"

But Satoru merely yawned again, bored. "I miss the days when debugging was challenging."

Later, during the daily stand-up meeting, the Senior Engineer addressed the team solemnly. "Today's disaster was unprecedented. To prevent future catastrophes, management implemented a new policy: 'Pair programming Mondays'."

Dread filled the room.

"And," the Senior Engineer continued, eyes twinkling mischievously, "One Review Man-san will pair with the newest member of our team, 'Framework Evangelist-san'."

From the back stepped forward a developer, smugly smiling, wearing a hoodie emblazoned with the logo of a new JavaScript framework.

"Framework Evangelist-san here," he announced confidently. "My framework, UltraJS, will revolutionize our stack. It's the future!"

Satoru raised an eyebrow. "Another framework? How original."

"Oh, you'll see," Framework Evangelist-san smirked. "Even your legendary skills might find UltraJS... challenging."

Genki clenched his fists. "Satoru-sensei needs no such thing. His code is flawless!"

Ignoring Genki's defense, Framework Evangelist-san leaned closer. "Let's pair program tomorrow, One Review Man-san. It'll be educational."

Satoru didn't reply, his expression unchanged. But inside, he felt a faint glimmer—could this finally be the boredom-breaking challenge he'd longed for?

That evening, alone in their workspace, Genki turned to his mentor seriously. "Satoru-sensei, do you really think this UltraJS is special?"

Satoru shrugged nonchalantly. "Probably not. But who knows. Maybe it'll at least be less boring."

Genki nodded solemnly. "I understand. I will also study UltraJS tonight. Please allow me to assist you tomorrow, Master."

"Sure," Satoru sighed, patting Genki's shoulder absently. "Knock yourself out, Genki."

"Thank you, Satoru-sensei!"

As they left the office, neither noticed the ominous blinking notification on Genki's monitor:

**Critical Alert: UltraJS detected. Warning: Framework instability level... catastrophic.**

Tomorrow, technology would fail again—but perhaps, at last, One Review Man would face a worthy challenge.
