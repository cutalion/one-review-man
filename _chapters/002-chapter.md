# Chapter 2: The Legacy Code Monster Appears!

"Is this... COBOL?" murmured Disciple-kun, his cybernetic eyes flickering wildly as they attempted to parse the ancient text on his screen.

"Not just any COBOL," replied a grizzled senior programmer known only as Legacy-sama. "This codebase has been untouched since the dawn of computing itself. Every developer who's attempted to refactor it... has mysteriously vanished from tech."

"Vanished?" Disciple-kun gulped, his neural implants overheating slightly from sheer anxiety.

"Yes," Legacy-sama whispered dramatically. "They all ended up as project managers."

Disciple-kun shuddered visibly.

Behind them, casually munching on convenience store ramen from a disposable cup, One Review Man stood quietly, eyes half-closed in boredom.

"One Review Man-san," Legacy-sama said, barely hiding disdain in his voice. "This is serious. We need you to pay attention."

"Hmm? Oh, sure," One Review Man replied, slurping noodles loudly. "Looks pretty straightforward, though."

Legacy-sama scoffed loudly. "Straightforward? This is the legendary 'Monolith of Madness.' It predates version control. It predates comments!"

"It predates documentation," whispered Disciple-kun in horror.

One Review Man shrugged nonchalantly. "Yeah, that just means less clutter, right? Shouldn't take more than a single review."

"Absurd!" Legacy-sama snapped. "You'll learn soon enough. The codebase has already consumed the sanity of countless developers."

Before One Review Man could finish his noodles, the office speakers crackled to life. The panicked voice of the CTO echoed through the room.

"Emergency! The Legacy Code Monster has awakened! Production is crashing! All senior engineers report immediately!"

Legacy-sama flinched, eyes wide. "It's too late... the COBOL beast is awake!"

Within minutes, the meeting room was overflowing with panicked developers. On the main screen, dashboards flashed red with critical errors.

AI-Enhanced Disciple turned to his mentor, voice trembling. "Shirogane-sensei, what should we do?"

One Review Man—Shirogane—yawned. "Oh, you know, the usual. Just rewrite the offending subroutine."

A nearby senior programmer overheard and laughed bitterly. "Rewrite? Ha! Clearly, One Review Man-san, you've never encountered legacy COBOL."

"Actually, I fixed a similar issue last month," Shirogane replied calmly, scratching his head. "Took about five minutes."

"Pure luck," muttered Legacy-sama bitterly.

Disciple-kun clenched his fists. "Sensei, allow me to assist! My neural implants have parsed every known COBOL dialect."

Shirogane nodded absently. "Sure, Disciple. Just don't overcomplicate it."

"Never, Shirogane-sensei!"

As the crisis escalated, programmers frantically attempted patches—each more disastrous than the last. Merge conflicts piled up. Deployment pipelines exploded spectacularly. Panic spread.

Disciple-kun, desperate to prove himself worthy, launched a complex AI-assisted debugging session. Virtual avatars and holographic code snippets whirled around him. Sweat poured down his brow.

"Almost there... neural net training at 98% accuracy... just a bit more..."

But the system rejected each patch violently. Screens flashed warnings: "ERROR: COBOL Beast resists modernization!"

Shirogane sighed, stepping forward. "Let me take a look."

"One Review Man-san," Legacy-sama called out mockingly. "You underestimate the beast. This isn't a trivial JavaScript bug!"

Ignoring the jeers, Shirogane calmly scrolled through the eldritch COBOL code. His eyes flicked once, twice...

"There."

He pressed a single key.

Everyone gasped.

The red dashboards instantly turned green. Error logs cleared. Production stabilized.

"How? Impossible!" Legacy-sama sputtered. "No one solves legacy COBOL in a single keystroke!"

Shirogane shrugged, already bored again. "It was just an off-by-one loop."

Legacy-sama staggered back, clutching his chest dramatically. "An off-by-one loop...? We spent decades..."

"It's just luck," another programmer murmured. "Anyone could've spotted it."

Disciple-kun stared in awe, his voice barely audible. "Shirogane-sensei... your power is truly unmatched..."

"Eh, it was pretty obvious," Shirogane replied casually, tossing away his empty ramen cup. "Anyway, what's next?"

"Next...?" Legacy-sama whispered, eyes wide. "Next is... the Framework Wars."
