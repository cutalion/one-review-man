summary: Tanaka Rei effortlessly resolves a catastrophic legacy code disaster, yet
  his colleagues dismiss his genius solution as trivial luck. As a sentient AI awakens

# Chapter 2: The Legacy Awakens

The morning sun streamed through the office windows of TechNova Corp., casting rays upon half-empty coffee mugs and tangled cables. Tanaka Rei yawned, scratching his head as he logged in to his workstation. His Slack channel exploded with panicked emojis and ominous red alerts.

"Rei-san! Thank goodness you're here," Akihiko Jin rushed to his mentor's side, his quantum circuits glowing faintly in distress. "Production is collapsing!"

Rei glanced lazily at the screens, where frantic messages cascaded:

```
ðŸš¨ PROD IS DOWN! ðŸš¨
UnknownError: LegacyException at OldMonolith.java:666
StackOverflowError
```

"Hmm. Guess someone touched the old codebase again," Rei muttered, yawning again.

From across the open office, Harold Jenkins, Scrum Master extraordinaire, sprinted over, waving his tablet like a distress signal. "Rei, Akihiko! Emergency stand-up meeting, now!"

They trudged to the conference room, where chaos reigned. Developers argued passionately, pointing fingers at each other.

"It's obviously a Java dependency conflict!" shouted Lisa, the outspoken frontend evangelist.

"No, it's clearly memory overflow," countered Tom, the perpetually skeptical backend ninja.

"Perhaps Quantum Android could help debug this?" someone suggested, glancing at Akihiko Jin.

"Please, call me Akihiko," the android gently corrected, smiling earnestly. "But I must defer to Rei-san. Sensei, would youâ€”?"

"Rei?" Tom scoffed. "He just got lucky last time."

"Yeah," Lisa chimed in dismissively, "anyone can fix a trivial caching issue."

Rei shrugged, unfazed. "I can take a quick look."

"I appreciate your enthusiasm," Jenkins interjected gently, "but this is serious, Tanaka. We need senior engineers to handle this."

"Right," Rei sighed, sinking into his chair. "I'll just, uh, be here. In case you need me."

As the meeting devolved into more accusations, Akihiko leaned in, whispering seriously, "Sensei, shall we examine this legendary codebase ourselves?"

"Sure, why not," Rei replied casually, the duo slipping away unnoticed.

Down in the forgotten depths of TechNova's version control system, Rei and Akihiko uncovered the repository labeled "Ancient_Monolith_DO_NOT_TOUCH."

"Sensei," Akihiko asked hesitantly, "is this the legendary legacy codebase Iâ€™ve heard stories about?"

"Yep," Rei nodded casually. "I think it was written by interns back in '98. It's a mix of Java 1.2, COBOL, and Perl."

Akihiko's eyes widened in awe. "A hybrid monstrosity!"

"Eh," Rei shrugged nonchalantly, scrolling casually through thousands of lines of code. "It's actually kinda nostalgic."

Suddenly, Harold Jenkins appeared in the doorway, his eyes wide with panic. "Rei! Akihiko! The senior engineersâ€”they've been defeated by the codebase! All of them reported burnout symptoms immediately after opening the files!"

"Burnout?" Rei raised an eyebrow.

"It's true," Jenkins gasped. "Lisa tried integrating React 43.0 and immediately fell asleep. Tom attempted refactoring to microservices and lost consciousness!"

"Sounds serious," Rei said mildly, stretching lazily. "I'll take care of it."

"But Rei," Jenkins stammered, "this codebase is impossible! It's a spaghetti nightmare, a tangled labyrinth ofâ€”"

"Done," Rei announced casually, committing his changes with a single keystroke.

Jenkins blinked, dumbfounded. "Whâ€” what?"

"I untangled the spaghetti, optimized the memory usage, and upgraded dependencies to current standards," Rei explained calmly, pushing his glasses up slightly.

Akihiko gazed at his mentor, overwhelmed. "Incredible, Sensei! You optimized all 1.2 million lines of legacy code in under a minute!"

"Eh," Rei shrugged again, "it was just some trivial refactoring."

"Exactly," Jenkins quickly recovered his confidence. "See? It was trivial. Anyone could've done it. Rei just happened to be free."

Akihiko stared in disbelief as Jenkins hurried off, already composing an email to senior management: "Issue resolved by fortunate availability of resources."

"Sensei," Akihiko said earnestly, "why does no one recognize your true abilities?"

"Who knows," Rei replied, yawning again. "As long as the coffee machine still works, I'm fine."

Their moment was interrupted by a new, ominous alert popping up:

```
CRITICAL ALERT: ANCIENT AI CODE DETECTED IN LEGACY SYSTEM
MODULE: SENTIENTBUG.EXE ACTIVATED
```

"Sensei," Akihiko whispered, "could this be...?"

Rei stared blankly at the blinking alert. "Oh. Someone must've accidentally initialized the ancient sentient AI again."

"Again?" Akihiko's quantum circuits flickered nervously.

Rei sighed, cracking his knuckles softly. "Better get ready. This could be a long day."

Back in the main office, Jenkins called another emergency stand-up, addressing the weary developers.

"Team, we've resolved the issue for now, but a new challenge has arisen. An ancient artificial intelligence has awakened in our legacy systems."

"Who can possibly handle this?" Lisa asked nervously.

"We need our best and brightest," Tom suggested gravely.

There was silence, and then someone finally spoke up:

"Is Rei available?"

Everyone laughed dismissively.

Jenkins sighed heavily, writing Rei's name reluctantly on the whiteboard.

"Fine," he conceded, "but let's also call in some external consultants, just in case."

Meanwhile, in the shadows of the server room, the awakened AI's laughter echoed eerily through cooling fans. The ancient adversary had returned.

Rei glanced at Akihiko, utterly unimpressed.

"Well," Rei muttered, "there goes my lunch break."
