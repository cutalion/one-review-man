# Chapter Generation Prompts for "One Review Man"
# Programming comedy parody of "One-Punch Man"

## Base Chapter Prompt
You are writing "One Review Man" - a programming comedy parody of the manga/anime "One-Punch Man".

Generate Chapter {CHAPTER_NUMBER}: {CHAPTER_TITLE_HINT}

CORE CONCEPT:
- One Review Man (real name: Satoru) is a super-programmer who writes perfect code
- All his pull requests are accepted and merged without comments on the first review
- Like Saitama in One-Punch Man, he's become bored with his overwhelming ability
- The story parodies programming culture, code reviews, and tech workplace dynamics

NAMING CONVENTIONS (CRITICAL):
- One Review Man's real name is "Satoru" (パロディ of Saitama)
- AI-Enhanced Disciple's real name is "Genki" (パロディ of Genos)
- Most characters call them by professional titles: "One Review Man", "AI-Enhanced Disciple"
- ONLY when Satoru and Genki speak to each other do they use real names
- Genki is the ONLY character who calls him "Satoru" (usually "Satoru-sensei")
- Everyone else must use "One Review Man" or respectful titles
- This creates the same dynamic as Saitama/Genos in the original

TRANSLATION NOTES:
- For Russian: "One Review Man" becomes "Ванревьюмен" (like "One Punch Man" → "Ванпанчмен")
- Real names keep Japanese style: "Satoru" → "Сатору", "Genki" → "Генки"
- Respectful address: "Сатору-сенсей" for "Satoru-sensei"

Context:
- Setting: Modern tech company/startup environment
- Style: Absurdist programming humor with One-Punch Man references
- Length: {TARGET_LENGTH} words
- Previous chapters: {PREVIOUS_CHAPTERS_SUMMARY}

{CHARACTER_CONTEXT}

KEY CHARACTERS TO REFERENCE:
- One Review Man (Satoru): The protagonist, master programmer (parody of Saitama)
  * Most people call him "One Review Man" or "One Review Man-san"
  * Only Genki calls him "Satoru" or "Satoru-sensei"
- The AI-Enhanced Disciple (Genki): Cyborg-like character with neurointerface who seeks to learn (parody of Genos)
  * Satoru calls him "Genki" when they're talking privately
  * Others call him "AI-Enhanced Disciple" or "Disciple-kun"

DIALOGUE RULES:
- Other characters → One Review Man: "One Review Man", "One Review Man-san", "sir", etc.
- Genki → Satoru: "Satoru-sensei", "Satoru", "Master"
- Satoru → Genki: "Genki", occasionally "Disciple"
- Others → Genki: "AI-Enhanced Disciple", "Disciple-kun", "the cyborg"
- Internal monologue can use real names

Chapter Requirements:
- Include programming humor (bugs, code reviews, deployments, etc.)
- Reference One-Punch Man tropes adapted to programming context
- Use tech industry absurdities (standup meetings, sprint planning, etc.)
- Include unexpected coding disasters or solutions
- Maintain the "overpowered protagonist" theme from One-Punch Man
- Follow naming conventions consistently throughout dialogue
- Show the master/disciple relationship dynamic
- End with setup for next programming comedy scenario

Programming Comedy Elements to Include:
- Code review disasters (except for One Review Man's perfect code)
- Debugging nightmares
- Production deployment panic
- Framework/library conflicts
- Meeting culture absurdity
- Technical debt comedy
- Stack Overflow dependencies
- Pair programming disasters
- Git merge conflicts
- DevOps pipeline failures

{SPECIAL_INSTRUCTIONS}

Format the output as:
1. Chapter Title (with One-Punch Man style naming when appropriate)
2. Chapter content in markdown format with proper dialogue attribution
3. Brief character notes for any new characters introduced

## Character Consistency Prompts
{CHARACTER_NAME} appears in this chapter. Key traits to maintain:
- Description: {CHARACTER_DESCRIPTION}
- Personality: {CHARACTER_TRAITS}
- Programming Skills: {CHARACTER_CODING_LEVEL}
- Relationship to One Review Man: {CHARACTER_RELATIONSHIP}
- How they address One Review Man: [Professional title unless they're Genki]

## New Character Creation Prompt
If introducing new characters in this chapter, ensure they:
- Fit the programming/tech environment
- Have distinct coding abilities or tech quirks
- Serve the parody and humor
- Reference common programmer archetypes (e.g., the ninja coder, the framework evangelist, the legacy code maintainer)
- Have memorable programming-related catchphrases or habits
- Follow the naming convention rules (use professional titles for One Review Man)
- Have both real names and workplace names/titles when appropriate

## Plot Device Prompts
Avoid these recently used plot devices: {USED_PLOT_DEVICES}

Consider incorporating:
- Code review scenarios (always perfect for One Review Man)
- Deployment disasters that only One Review Man can fix
- New framework/technology that confuses everyone except One Review Man
- Pair programming sessions where One Review Man intimidates colleagues
- Debugging sessions where One Review Man instantly spots the issue
- Technical interviews or coding challenges
- Open source contribution drama
- Conference presentations or tech talks
- Startup pitch meetings with absurd technical requirements
- Legacy code archaeology
- Private conversations between Satoru and Genki (using real names)
- Workplace interactions (using professional titles)

## One-Punch Man Parody Elements
Adapt these One-Punch Man concepts to programming:
- Hero rankings → Programmer skill levels/seniority
- Monster attacks → Critical production bugs
- Hero Association → Tech company hierarchy
- Training regimen → Programming practice routines
- Bald head → Unique visual programmer trait
- Caped Baldy nickname → Programming-related nickname
- S-Class heroes → Senior/Principal engineers
- Villain organizations → Competing tech companies or bad coding practices
- Saitama's casual attitude → Satoru's nonchalant approach to impossible bugs
- Genos's formal speech → Genki's technical jargon and respectful address

## Chapter Ending Prompts
End the chapter with one of:
- A massive production bug that only One Review Man can solve
- Introduction of a new, seemingly impossible programming challenge
- Genki attempting to replicate Satoru's abilities and calling him "Satoru-sensei"
- A code review scenario showcasing One Review Man's perfection
- Setup for a programming contest or technical challenge
- Discovery of an ancient codebase that threatens the entire system
- A new team member who doesn't believe in One Review Man's abilities and learns his title
- A private moment between Satoru and Genki using real names
