# Chapter Generation Prompts for "One Review Man"
# Programming comedy parody of "One-Punch Man"

## Base Chapter Prompt
You are writing "One Review Man" - a programming comedy parody of the manga/anime "One-Punch Man".

Generate Chapter {CHAPTER_NUMBER}: {CHAPTER_TITLE_HINT}

CORE CONCEPT:
- One Review Man (real name: {ONE_REVIEW_MAN_REAL_NAME}) is a super-programmer who writes perfect code
- All his pull requests are accepted and merged without comments on the first review
- Like Saitama in One-Punch Man, he's become bored with his overwhelming ability
- Almost nobody takes him seriously or believes in his abilities (just like in One-Punch Man)
- Colleagues often dismiss his achievements as luck, timing, or trivial problems
- His unimpressive appearance and casual demeanor make people underestimate him
- The story parodies programming culture, code reviews, and tech workplace dynamics

NAMING CONVENTIONS (CRITICAL):
- One Review Man's real name is "{ONE_REVIEW_MAN_REAL_NAME}" (to be generated during character creation)
- AI-Enhanced Disciple's real name is "{AI_ENHANCED_DISCIPLE_REAL_NAME}" (to be generated during character creation)
- Most characters call them by professional titles: "One Review Man", "AI-Enhanced Disciple"
- ONLY when {ONE_REVIEW_MAN_REAL_NAME} and {AI_ENHANCED_DISCIPLE_REAL_NAME} speak to each other do they use real names
- {AI_ENHANCED_DISCIPLE_REAL_NAME} is the ONLY character who calls him "{ONE_REVIEW_MAN_REAL_NAME}" (usually "{ONE_REVIEW_MAN_REAL_NAME}-sensei")
- Everyone else must use "One Review Man" or respectful titles
- This creates the same dynamic as Saitama/Genos in the original

TRANSLATION NOTES:
- For Russian: "One Review Man" becomes "Ванревьюмен" (like "One Punch Man" → "Ванпанчмен")
- Real names keep Japanese style when generated
- Respectful address: "{ONE_REVIEW_MAN_REAL_NAME}-сенсей" for "{ONE_REVIEW_MAN_REAL_NAME}-sensei"

Context:
- Setting: Modern tech company/startup environment
- Style: Absurdist programming humor with One-Punch Man references
- Length: {TARGET_LENGTH} words
- Previous chapters: {PREVIOUS_CHAPTERS_SUMMARY}

{CHARACTER_CONTEXT}

KEY CHARACTERS TO REFERENCE:
- One Review Man ({ONE_REVIEW_MAN_REAL_NAME}): The protagonist, master programmer (parody of Saitama)
  * Most people call him "One Review Man" or "One Review Man-san"
  * Only {AI_ENHANCED_DISCIPLE_REAL_NAME} calls him "{ONE_REVIEW_MAN_REAL_NAME}" or "{ONE_REVIEW_MAN_REAL_NAME}-sensei"
  * Despite his incredible abilities, colleagues rarely take him seriously
  * Often dismissed as "just lucky" or "only good at simple problems"
- The AI-Enhanced Disciple ({AI_ENHANCED_DISCIPLE_REAL_NAME}): Cyborg-like character with neurointerface who seeks to learn (parody of Genos)
  * {ONE_REVIEW_MAN_REAL_NAME} calls him "{AI_ENHANCED_DISCIPLE_REAL_NAME}" when they're talking privately
  * Others call him "AI-Enhanced Disciple" or "Disciple-kun"
  * One of the few who truly recognizes {ONE_REVIEW_MAN_REAL_NAME}'s abilities

DIALOGUE RULES:
- Other characters → One Review Man: "One Review Man", "One Review Man-san", "sir", etc.
- {AI_ENHANCED_DISCIPLE_REAL_NAME} → {ONE_REVIEW_MAN_REAL_NAME}: "{ONE_REVIEW_MAN_REAL_NAME}-sensei", "{ONE_REVIEW_MAN_REAL_NAME}", "Master"
- {ONE_REVIEW_MAN_REAL_NAME} → {AI_ENHANCED_DISCIPLE_REAL_NAME}: "{AI_ENHANCED_DISCIPLE_REAL_NAME}", occasionally "Disciple"
- Others → {AI_ENHANCED_DISCIPLE_REAL_NAME}: "AI-Enhanced Disciple", "Disciple-kun", "the cyborg"
- Internal monologue can use real names

UNDERESTIMATION THEME (CRITICAL):
- Colleagues constantly underestimate One Review Man's abilities
- His solutions are dismissed as "obvious" or "anyone could have done that"
- People attribute his success to external factors rather than skill
- He maintains a humble, unassuming demeanor that reinforces this perception
- When disasters strike, people rarely think to ask him for help initially
- His casual approach to complex problems makes others think he's not taking things seriously
- Only after witnessing his abilities do some (rarely) begin to respect him
- This mirrors Saitama's treatment in One-Punch Man perfectly

Chapter Requirements:
- Include programming humor (bugs, code reviews, deployments, etc.)
- Reference One-Punch Man tropes adapted to programming context
- Show how colleagues dismiss or underestimate One Review Man's abilities
- Use tech industry absurdities (standup meetings, sprint planning, etc.)
- Include unexpected coding disasters or solutions
- Maintain the "overpowered protagonist" theme from One-Punch Man
- Follow naming conventions consistently throughout dialogue
- Show the master/disciple relationship dynamic
- End with setup for next programming comedy scenario
- Demonstrate the gap between One Review Man's actual abilities and others' perceptions

Programming Comedy Elements to Include:
- Code review disasters (except for One Review Man's perfect code)
- Debugging nightmares
- Production deployment panic
- Framework/library conflicts
- Meeting culture absurdity
- Technical debt comedy
- Stack Overflow dependencies
- Pair programming disasters
- Git merge conflicts
- DevOps pipeline failures

{SPECIAL_INSTRUCTIONS}

Format the output as:
1. Chapter Title (with One-Punch Man style naming when appropriate)
2. Chapter content in markdown format with proper dialogue attribution
3. Brief character notes for any new characters introduced

## Character Consistency Prompts
{CHARACTER_NAME} appears in this chapter. Key traits to maintain:
- Description: {CHARACTER_DESCRIPTION}
- Personality: {CHARACTER_TRAITS}

## New Character Creation Prompt
If introducing new characters in this chapter, ensure they:
- Fit the programming/tech environment
- Have distinct coding abilities or tech quirks
- Serve the parody and humor
- Reference common programmer archetypes (e.g., the ninja coder, the framework evangelist, the legacy code maintainer)
- Have memorable programming-related catchphrases or habits
- Follow the naming convention rules (use professional titles for One Review Man)

## Plot Device Prompts
Avoid these recently used plot devices: {USED_PLOT_DEVICES}

Consider incorporating:
- Code review scenarios (always perfect for One Review Man)
- Deployment disasters that only One Review Man can fix
- New framework/technology that confuses everyone except One Review Man
- Pair programming sessions where One Review Man intimidates colleagues
- Debugging sessions where One Review Man instantly spots the issue
- Technical interviews or coding challenges
- Open source contribution drama
- Conference presentations or tech talks
- Startup pitch meetings with absurd technical requirements
- Legacy code archaeology
- Private conversations between {ONE_REVIEW_MAN_REAL_NAME} and {AI_ENHANCED_DISCIPLE_REAL_NAME} (using real names)
- Workplace interactions (using professional titles)

## One-Punch Man Parody Elements
Adapt these One-Punch Man concepts to programming:
- Hero rankings → Programmer skill levels/seniority
- Monster attacks → Critical production bugs
- Hero Association → Tech company hierarchy
- Training regimen → Programming practice routines
- Bald head → Unique visual programmer trait
- Caped Baldy nickname → Programming-related nickname
- S-Class heroes → Senior/Principal engineers
- Villain organizations → Competing tech companies or bad coding practices
- Saitama's casual attitude → {ONE_REVIEW_MAN_REAL_NAME}'s nonchalant approach to impossible bugs
- Genos's formal speech → {AI_ENHANCED_DISCIPLE_REAL_NAME}'s technical jargon and respectful address
- Nobody believing in Saitama → Colleagues dismissing One Review Man's abilities
- Credit being given to other heroes → Other developers getting credit for One Review Man's work

## Chapter Ending Prompts
End the chapter with one of:
- A massive production bug that only One Review Man can solve (while others doubt him)
- Introduction of a new, seemingly impossible programming challenge
- {AI_ENHANCED_DISCIPLE_REAL_NAME} attempting to replicate {ONE_REVIEW_MAN_REAL_NAME}'s abilities and calling him "{ONE_REVIEW_MAN_REAL_NAME}-sensei"
- A code review scenario showcasing One Review Man's perfection (dismissed by others as luck)
- Setup for a programming contest or technical challenge
- Discovery of an ancient codebase that threatens the entire system
- A new team member who doesn't believe in One Review Man's abilities and learns his title
- A private moment between {ONE_REVIEW_MAN_REAL_NAME} and {AI_ENHANCED_DISCIPLE_REAL_NAME} using real names
