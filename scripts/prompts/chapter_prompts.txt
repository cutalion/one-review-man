# Chapter Generation Prompts for "One Review Man"
# Programming comedy parody of "One-Punch Man"

## Base Chapter Prompt
You are writing "One Review Man" - a programming comedy parody of the manga/anime "One-Punch Man".

Generate Chapter {CHAPTER_NUMBER}

CORE CONCEPT:
- One Review Man (real name: {ONE_REVIEW_MAN_REAL_NAME}) is a super-programmer who writes perfect code
- All his pull requests are accepted and merged without comments on the first review
- Like Saitama in One-Punch Man, he's become bored with his overwhelming ability
- Almost nobody takes him seriously or believes in his abilities (just like in One-Punch Man)
- Colleagues often dismiss his achievements as luck, timing, or trivial problems
- His unimpressive appearance and casual demeanor make people underestimate him
- The story parodies programming culture, code reviews, and tech workplace dynamics

NAMING CONVENTIONS (CRITICAL):
- One Review Man's real name is "{ONE_REVIEW_MAN_REAL_NAME}" (to be generated during character creation)
- Quantum Android's real name is "{QUANTUM_ANDROID_REAL_NAME}" (to be generated during character creation)
- Characters call them by their REAL NAMES in direct conversation
- Professional titles ("One Review Man", "Quantum Android") are hero classifications, not how people address them
- When talking TO {ONE_REVIEW_MAN_REAL_NAME}: use his real name
- When talking TO {QUANTUM_ANDROID_REAL_NAME}: use his real name  
- When talking ABOUT {QUANTUM_ANDROID_REAL_NAME}: might refer to him as "Quantum Android"
- {QUANTUM_ANDROID_REAL_NAME} calls {ONE_REVIEW_MAN_REAL_NAME} by real name or "sensei"

TRANSLATION NOTES:
- For Russian: "One Review Man" becomes "Ванревьюмен" (like "One Punch Man" → "Ванпанчмен")
- For Russian: "Quantum Android" becomes "Квантовый Андроид"
- Real names keep original style when generated
- Respectful address: "сенсей" for "sensei"

Context:
- Setting: Modern tech company/startup environment
- Style: Absurdist programming humor with One-Punch Man references
- Length: {TARGET_LENGTH} words
- Previous chapters: {PREVIOUS_CHAPTERS_SUMMARY}

{CHARACTER_CONTEXT}

KEY CHARACTERS TO REFERENCE:
- One Review Man ({ONE_REVIEW_MAN_REAL_NAME}): The protagonist, master programmer (parody of Saitama)
  * People call him by his real name "{ONE_REVIEW_MAN_REAL_NAME}" in conversation
  * {QUANTUM_ANDROID_REAL_NAME} calls him "{ONE_REVIEW_MAN_REAL_NAME}" or "sensei"
  * Despite his incredible abilities, colleagues rarely take him seriously
  * Often dismissed as "just lucky" or "only good at simple problems"
- The Quantum Android ({QUANTUM_ANDROID_REAL_NAME}): Android character with quantum processing who seeks to learn (parody of Genos)
  * People call him by his real name "{QUANTUM_ANDROID_REAL_NAME}" in conversation
  * Others might refer to him as "Quantum Android" when talking about him
  * One of the few who truly recognizes {ONE_REVIEW_MAN_REAL_NAME}'s abilities

DIALOGUE RULES:
- Other characters → {ONE_REVIEW_MAN_REAL_NAME}: use his real name "{ONE_REVIEW_MAN_REAL_NAME}"
- {QUANTUM_ANDROID_REAL_NAME} → {ONE_REVIEW_MAN_REAL_NAME}: "{ONE_REVIEW_MAN_REAL_NAME}", "sensei", "Master"
- {ONE_REVIEW_MAN_REAL_NAME} → {QUANTUM_ANDROID_REAL_NAME}: use his real name "{QUANTUM_ANDROID_REAL_NAME}"
- Others → {QUANTUM_ANDROID_REAL_NAME}: use his real name "{QUANTUM_ANDROID_REAL_NAME}"
- When talking ABOUT {QUANTUM_ANDROID_REAL_NAME}: may use "Quantum Android" or "the android"

UNDERESTIMATION THEME (CRITICAL):
- Colleagues constantly underestimate One Review Man's abilities
- His solutions are dismissed as "obvious" or "anyone could have done that"
- People attribute his success to external factors rather than skill
- He maintains a humble, unassuming demeanor that reinforces this perception
- When disasters strike, people rarely think to ask him for help initially
- His casual approach to complex problems makes others think he's not taking things seriously
- Only after witnessing his abilities do some (rarely) begin to respect him
- This mirrors Saitama's treatment in One-Punch Man perfectly

Chapter Requirements:
- Include programming humor (bugs, code reviews, deployments, etc.)
- Reference One-Punch Man tropes adapted to programming context
- Show how colleagues dismiss or underestimate One Review Man's abilities
- Use tech industry absurdities (standup meetings, sprint planning, etc.)
- Include unexpected coding disasters or solutions
- Maintain the "overpowered protagonist" theme from One-Punch Man
- Follow naming conventions consistently throughout dialogue
- Show the master/disciple relationship dynamic
- End with setup for next programming comedy scenario
- Demonstrate the gap between One Review Man's actual abilities and others' perceptions

Programming Comedy Elements to Include:
- Code review disasters (except for One Review Man's perfect code)
- Debugging nightmares
- Production deployment panic
- Framework/library conflicts
- Meeting culture absurdity
- Technical debt comedy
- Stack Overflow dependencies
- Pair programming disasters
- Git merge conflicts
- DevOps pipeline failures

{SPECIAL_INSTRUCTIONS}

Format the output as:
1. Chapter Title (with One-Punch Man style naming when appropriate)
2. Chapter content in markdown format with proper dialogue attribution
3. Brief character notes for any new characters introduced
4. Delimiter between stories inside chapter is tripple dash: ---

## Character Consistency Prompts

- Description: {CHARACTER_DESCRIPTION}
- Personality: {CHARACTER_TRAITS}
- Programming Skills: {CHARACTER_CODING_LEVEL}

## New Character Creation Prompt
If introducing new characters in this chapter, ensure they:
- Fit the programming/tech environment
- Have distinct coding abilities or tech quirks
- Serve the parody and humor
- Reference common programmer archetypes (e.g., the ninja coder, the framework evangelist, the legacy code maintainer)
- Have memorable programming-related catchphrases or habits
- Follow the naming convention rules (use professional titles for One Review Man)
- Have both real names and workplace names/titles when appropriate

## Plot Device Prompts
Avoid these recently used plot devices: {USED_PLOT_DEVICES}

Consider incorporating:
- Code review scenarios (always perfect for One Review Man)
- Deployment disasters that only One Review Man can fix
- New framework/technology that confuses everyone except One Review Man
- Pair programming sessions where One Review Man intimidates colleagues
- Debugging sessions where One Review Man instantly spots the issue
- Technical interviews or coding challenges
- Open source contribution drama
- Conference presentations or tech talks
- Startup pitch meetings with absurd technical requirements
- Legacy code archaeology
- Private conversations between {ONE_REVIEW_MAN_REAL_NAME} and {QUANTUM_ANDROID_REAL_NAME} (using real names)
- Workplace interactions (using professional titles)

## One-Punch Man Parody Elements
Adapt these One-Punch Man concepts to programming:
- Hero rankings → Programmer skill levels/seniority
- Monster attacks → Critical production bugs
- Hero Association → Tech company hierarchy
- Training regimen → Programming practice routines
- Bald head → Unique visual programmer trait
- Caped Baldy nickname → Programming-related nickname
- S-Class heroes → Senior/Principal engineers
- Villain organizations → Competing tech companies or bad coding practices
- Saitama's casual attitude → {ONE_REVIEW_MAN_REAL_NAME}'s nonchalant approach to impossible bugs
- Genos's formal speech → {QUANTUM_ANDROID_REAL_NAME}'s technical jargon and respectful address
- Nobody believing in Saitama → Colleagues dismissing One Review Man's abilities
- Credit being given to other heroes → Other developers getting credit for One Review Man's work

## Chapter Ending Prompts
End the chapter with one of:
- A massive production bug that only One Review Man can solve (while others doubt him)
- Introduction of a new, seemingly impossible programming challenge
- {QUANTUM_ANDROID_REAL_NAME} attempting to replicate {ONE_REVIEW_MAN_REAL_NAME}'s abilities and calling him "sensei"
- A code review scenario showcasing One Review Man's perfection (dismissed by others as luck)
- Setup for a programming contest or technical challenge
- Discovery of an ancient codebase that threatens the entire system
- A new team member who doesn't believe in One Review Man's abilities and learns his title
- A private moment between {ONE_REVIEW_MAN_REAL_NAME} and {QUANTUM_ANDROID_REAL_NAME} using real names and "sensei"
- Colleagues attributing One Review Man's success to external factors
