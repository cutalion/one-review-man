## About Anya

A brilliant but perpetually stressed DevOps guru who battles nightly with catastrophic deployment nightmares and infrastructure meltdowns.

## Backstory

Once enthusiastic about automation and deployment pipelines, Anya climbed swiftly through the tech ranks as a DevOps expert. However, after one too many catastrophic late-night production outages, she developed an uncanny paranoia about deployments, earning her the nickname 'DevOps Diva'. She is now infamous in the company for her dramatic Slack messages, detailed incident reports, and meticulous post-mortemsâ€”though secretly she dreams of a life without pager alerts.

## Notable Quirks

Carries around a plush Kubernetes pod mascot named 'Pody' for emotional support during stressful deployments; compulsively checks monitoring dashboards every five minutes.

## Catchphrase

> "It worked on my staging environment!"
