## About Backend Ninja

A confident, dismissive backend developer well-known for masterfully crafting overly complex and scalable solutions, yet frequently underestimating others—especially One Review Man.

## Backstory

Kenji began his tech journey as an intern at a big tech company, quickly climbing ranks due to his prodigious skill in creating backend monstrosities that no one dared question. His reputation grew so large that he adopted the moniker 'Backend Ninja', convinced backend programming is the only true form of software engineering. His inflated ego often blinds him to the simpler, more elegant approaches others—particularly One Review Man—bring to the table.

## Notable Quirks

Always wears dark hoodies and sunglasses indoors, even in meetings. Constantly dismisses frontend developers’ concerns by saying they 'just don’t understand real engineering.'

## Catchphrase

> "Frontend? Never heard of her."
