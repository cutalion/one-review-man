## About Shirogane

An unassuming yet incredibly gifted programmer able to solve any coding task perfectly with just a single code review, often underestimated due to his casual appearance and laid-back attitude.

## Backstory

Originally an overlooked junior developer assigned to mundane bug-fixing tasks, Shirogane grew tired of repetitive reviews and endless meetings. After one particularly tedious bug-fixing spree that lasted an entire weekend, he achieved a mysterious level of clarity and coding enlightenment, making him capable of resolving any code issue with a simple glance. Now he lives as the quietly legendary 'One Review Man', solving impossible problems with ease and frustrating ambitious rivals who struggle to match his effortless genius.

## Notable Quirks

Always wears headphones but rarely listens to anything, secretly binge-watches obscure tech tutorials purely for entertainment, tends to fall asleep during long meetings yet wakes up with the perfect solution already in mind.

## Catchphrase

> "It's fixed now. Don't mention it."
