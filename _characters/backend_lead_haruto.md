## About Backend Lead Haruto

A veteran backend engineer known for his vast experience but infamous for panicking at the slightest sign of production issues. Deeply skeptical of younger teammates and newcomers, he habitually questions their every decision.

## Backstory

Haruto began his career in the early days of enterprise software, shaped by traumatic outages and catastrophic deployments. His numerous encounters with midnight server crashes made him extremely cautious. Now, he's the paranoid guardian of the company's backend systems, balancing technical brilliance with a hair-trigger panic response.

## Notable Quirks

Always carries around an emergency stress ball labeled 'Rollback Button'. Tends to nervously refresh monitoring dashboards even on calm days.

## Catchphrase

> "Wait, you're deploying THAT to production!?"
