## About Legacy-sama

An elderly and deeply respected senior programmer fixated on preserving and worshipping ancient codebases, stubbornly resisting modern programming frameworks and methodologies.

## Backstory

Once celebrated as a genius programmer in the early days of computing, Legacy-sama's contributions shaped foundational software still quietly running behind the scenes today. With the rise of trendy programming paradigms and frameworks, he grew bitter and cynical, retreating to the dim corners of tech companies to eternally maintain legacy systems. Now, armed with a keyboard older than most coworkers, he passionately defends ancient, unchanging code against 'reckless' modern enhancements.

## Notable Quirks

Always wears vintage programmer glasses and a worn-out t-shirt from an obscure 1980s programming conference; refuses to code in anything newer than Windows XP; compulsively keeps a printed stack overflow of documentation on his desk.

## Catchphrase

> "If it ain't broke, don't refactor it!"
