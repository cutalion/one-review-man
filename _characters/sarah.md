## About Sarah

An unfailingly optimistic Scrum Master devoted to nurturing team morale, keeping processes smooth, and protecting the team from productivity-sapping interruptions and pointless meetings.

## Backstory

Once a developer herself, Sarah realized early on that her true passion lay not in writing code but in organizing chaos. After a devastating bug outbreak at her previous company—a notorious incident she nicknamed 'Bugnarok'—she vowed never again to let a team's morale falter. Now as Scrum Sentinel, she tirelessly safeguards her team from burnout, fights productivity blockers, and passionately believes a cheerful sprint retrospective can fix any problem.

## Notable Quirks

Always keeps emergency morale-booster kit at her desk containing candy, stress balls, and motivational sticky notes; frequently sprinkles agile-themed puns into conversation; owns an extensive collection of novelty coffee mugs emblazoned with tech humor.

## Catchphrase

> "Teamwork makes the stream work!"
