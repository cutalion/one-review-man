## About Tim Cole

Quiet, unassuming programmer whose code is always flawlessly perfect, secretly the legendary coder whose pull requests are merged at first glance without comments.

## Backstory

After enduring countless code reviews that nitpicked his early work, Satoru embarked on a rigorous and solitary coding regimenâ€”solving every LeetCode problem, reading every 'Clean Code' book multiple times, and coding without reliance on Stack Overflow. This transformed him into the mythical 'One Review Man,' whose code is so impeccable that it requires only a single glance to merge.

## Notable Quirks

Always arrives exactly on time to standups but rarely says more than 'no blockers'. Often mistaken for an intern due to his casual attire and humble demeanor.

## Catchphrase

> "It compiled, didn't it?"
