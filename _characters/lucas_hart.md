## About Lucas Hart

An overly energetic and flashy new developer obsessed with the latest JavaScript frameworks. Lucas constantly advocates for unnecessarily complex solutions, believing cutting-edge technology solves all problems.

## Backstory

Lucas became a developer shortly after attending a flashy tech conference, where he witnessed a charismatic keynote speaker effortlessly demo a sleek JavaScript framework on stage. Inspired, Lucas dedicated himself to mastering every new framework announced online, quickly earning himself the nickname 'The Framework Evangelist.' Despite colleagues' protests, he remains convinced that every problem is just one new framework away from perfection. Initially skeptical of Satoru's simplistic-yet-perfect code, Lucas dismisses him as outdated and stubborn, unaware of Satoru's unparalleled abilities.

## Notable Quirks

Always wears shirts and stickers from obscure conferences nobody else attended, speaks in jargon-heavy buzzwords, and constantly interrupts meetings to propose unnecessarily complex solutions.

## Catchphrase

> "Have you tried rewriting it in a newer framework?"
