## About Frontend Developer Tanaka

A cynical frontend developer who consistently doubts the legendary debugging abilities of One Review Man, attributing his successes purely to luck and trivialities.

## Backstory

Once considered the frontend prodigy of Silicon City, Tanaka quickly rose through the ranks with his impeccable UI designs and code elegance. However, the sudden emergence and praise showered upon the mysterious 'One Review Man' threatens his carefully curated status as the city's best coder. Convinced that coding skills can't simply be perfected with a single review, Tanaka now dedicates his free time to exposing what he believes is the overhyped reputation of One Review Man.

## Notable Quirks
