## About Clara

Senior developer infamous for constantly dealing with messy merge conflicts; deeply skeptical and critical of Satoru's seemingly perfect code commits.

## Backstory

Once a passionate and idealistic coder, Clara became jaded after years spent untangling catastrophic merges caused by reckless colleagues. Her unmatched skill in conflict resolution earned her the ironic title 'Merge Conflict Mistress', a nickname she hates but secretly takes pride in. Witnessing Satoru (One Review Man) making flawless commits with zero merge conflicts irritates and perplexes her, fueling her skepticism towards his abilities.

## Notable Quirks

Always carries around a stress ball shaped like a Git logo; audibly sighs whenever someone pushes directly to 'main'.

## Catchphrase

> "Looks greatâ€”until someone else commits."
