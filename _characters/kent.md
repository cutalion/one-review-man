## About Kent

A junior developer perpetually stuck in debugging hell, entirely dependent on Stack Overflow for even the simplest tasks.

## Backstory

Kent was hired straight out of a coding bootcamp promising "Full-Stack Mastery in 30 Days." Quickly overwhelmed by real-world development, he discovered Stack Overflow as his lifeline. Now infamous for copy-pasting solutions without fully understanding them, Kent dreams of the day he'll confidently write original code without a browser window open.

## Notable Quirks

Has over 100 open browser tabs at any given time, constantly refreshing Stack Overflow. His IDE is always in dark mode because 'it's easier to hide the shameful code snippets he pastes.'

## Catchphrase

> "If it's not on Stack Overflow, does it even exist?"
