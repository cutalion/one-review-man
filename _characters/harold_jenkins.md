## About Harold Jenkins

The team's tired Scrum Master, perpetually stressed by deployment disasters and the team's dysfunction, who spends his days desperately trying to herd chaotic developers through Agile ceremonies.

## Backstory

Once a talented developer, Harold transitioned into project management seeking a calmer path. Ironically, he ended up managing a notoriously dysfunctional team, dealing daily with critical production bugs and endless merge conflicts. He dreams of someday achieving a sprint retrospective without tears.

## Notable Quirks

Carries an oversized stress ball everywhere he goes and unconsciously squeezes it furiously during stand-ups. Drinks an alarming amount of coffee and nervously updates Jira tickets even on weekends.

## Catchphrase

> "Can we take that offline, please?"
