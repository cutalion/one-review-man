## About Carlos Rivera

An eccentric Senior Engineer infamous for his chaotic workspace, caffeine dependence, and unmatched debugging skills. Known for his skepticism, he frequently dismisses Satoru's flawless code as sheer luck, stubbornly refusing to acknowledge Satoru's true genius.

## Backstory

Once a promising young coder inspired to change the world, Carlos quickly became jaded after years spent maintaining ancient legacy codebases. Having seen countless production meltdowns, he embraced chaos and caffeine, evolving into the Debugging Ninjaâ€”feared and respected for his ability to unravel even the most convoluted bugs. Despite his constant grumbling and skepticism towards newcomers, deep down he secretly admires true programming talent, though he'd never openly admit it.

## Notable Quirks

Consumes excessive amounts of coffee, leaves dozens of empty mugs scattered around his workspace, and decorates his desk with ninja-themed memorabilia. Only listens to synthwave music when debugging critical issues.

## Catchphrase

> "It's not a bug, it's an undocumented feature!"
