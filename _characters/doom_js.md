## About Doom.js

An infamously complicated JavaScript framework developer specializing in quantum state management, whose cryptic documentation and inscrutable code structure make him both feared and admired in the tech community.

## Backstory

Originally a promising frontend engineer, Dominic spiraled into complexity obsession after discovering quantum physics documentaries. Determined to merge physics concepts with JavaScript, he created Doom.jsâ€”a framework so sophisticated that even senior architects avoid mentioning it in meetings. Despite widespread confusion, Dominic proudly believes his masterpiece represents the next evolution in programming, dismissing simpler frameworks as 'child's play.'

## Notable Quirks

Always carries around a Rubik's cube he never solves, claims that proper documentation ruins the 'mystery' of coding, often speaks in riddles referencing quantum mechanics.

## Catchphrase

> "It's not complicated, you just haven't reached enlightenment yet."
