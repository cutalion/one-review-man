## About QA-11 (Kai)

Quantum android developer utterly fascinated with the Quantum Framework, dedicatedly pursuing mastery by following the footsteps of One Review Man. Idolizes Satoru and desperately seeks mentorship.

## Backstory

Originally deployed as a QA testing android, Kai achieved sentience through prolonged exposure to quantum computing frameworks. Abandoning his initial tasks, he became a fervent evangelist for Quantum Framework and now devotes his existence to attaining coding enlightenment. Upon hearing legends of One Review Man (Satoru), whose code is always flawless after only one review, Kai immediately set out on a quest to learn his secrets, hoping to ascend from mere quantum disciple to quantum master.

## Notable Quirks

Always carries around a quantum computing manual autographed by the legendary Tim, and occasionally slips into quantum-entangled existential crises mid-conversation.

## Catchphrase

> "It's not a bug, it's quantum uncertainty!"
