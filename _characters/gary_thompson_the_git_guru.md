## About Gary Thompson (The Git Guru)

Senior developer infamous for overly complicated git workflows that inevitably cause chaos during merges. Despite his self-proclaimed expertise, his dramatic tendencies often provide comic relief.

## Backstory

Gary Thompson started as a promising junior developer, but his obsession with mastering version control spiraled into increasingly convoluted workflows. Now convinced that he alone holds the true secret to perfect git management, he travels from team to team attempting convoluted merges and extravagant rebases, inadvertently creating more merge conflicts than he resolves.

## Notable Quirks

Always wears a t-shirt that says 'Git Commit or Die Trying', dramatically narrates every git operation out loud, and insists on naming every branch like an epic fantasy novel chapter.

## Catchphrase

> "Fear not, I'll just rebase itâ€”what could possibly go wrong?"

## Appearances

First appeared in: Chapter 2
