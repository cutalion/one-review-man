## About Kai Nakamura

An earnest and overly formal junior developer android who idolizes Satoru (One Review Man) as his mentor and diligently strives to master flawless coding techniques.

## Backstory

Quantum Android QA-07X, originally built as a prototype quality-assurance android by a tech startup obsessed with bug-free releases, gained sentience after being inadvertently exposed to an experimental AI upgrade script. Deeply respectful of hierarchy and protocol, Kai immediately sought out the legendary One Review Man (Satoru) to learn the path of perfect code. Kai believes that perfection is attainable through disciplined adherence to code reviews and meticulous documentation.

## Notable Quirks

Often misunderstands idiomatic speech and metaphors, leading to hilariously awkward social interactions. Always carries around a digital notebook to record Satoru's coding 'wisdom', frequently quoting him verbatim in meetings.

## Catchphrase

> "Sensei, your code review is my guiding quantum state!"
