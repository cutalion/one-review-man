## About Hayato

A young, enthusiastic programmer who has undergone experimental cybernetic enhancements to boost his learning speed and programming prowess, seeking guidance from the legendary programmer Shirogane.

## Backstory

Formerly an ordinary junior developer struggling to complete even basic programming tickets, Hayato volunteered for a controversial cybernetic upgrade called "Code Augmentation Procedure." Now enhanced with powerful AI integration, he tirelessly follows Shirogane, hoping to master the one-line review technique and become the greatest programmer alive.

## Notable Quirks

Frequently misinterprets jokes due to overly literal AI enhancements, and has a tendency to ask overly specific programming questions at inappropriate moments.

## Catchphrase

> "I shall assimilate your wisdom, sensei!"
