## About Emily Chen

An anxious but talented Database Administrator who manages critical databases at the heart of the infrastructure. She is widely respected by her peers despite frequently panicking when outages occur.

## Backstory

Emily became known as The Panic DBA after single-handedly restoring production databases during a traumatic outage early in her career. Although she suffers from anxiety whenever something goes wrong, her record for successful disaster recoveries is unmatched. She secretly idolizes Satoru (One Review Man) for always pushing perfect code and dreams of one day coding as calmly as he does under pressure.

## Notable Quirks

Always carries multiple caffeinated beverages; her desk is decorated with sticky notes labeled "DON'T PANIC" in big, colorful letters.

## Catchphrase

> "Is it replication lag, or am I just lagging behind reality?"
