## About Haruka Ito (Regex Ronin)

A senior engineer who wanders the codebase like a lone samurai, cleaving bugs and stray newline demons with labyrinthine regular expressions. Admired for her surgical grep-fu yet still oblivious to Satoru’s effortless supremacy.

## Backstory

Haruka began as a freelance data-cleaner, spending half a year trapped in a cursed CSV from 1998. Emerging fluent in escape sequences, she vowed to never let malformed input threaten production again. Recruited by the Hero Association’s Platform Squad, she earned the title Regex Ronin after neutralizing the infamous JSON Hydra outage with a 240-character negative look-behind.

## Notable Quirks

Keeps a laminated regex cheat sheet in her badge holder, writes commit messages exclusively in haiku, and greets coworkers with slash-notation emojis like /o\.

## Catchphrase

> ""If it has a pattern, it has a weakness.""
