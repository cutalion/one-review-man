## About Scrum Master

A bored, apathetic facilitator of daily standup meetings who has completely lost enthusiasm after years of repetitive agile processes. He navigates team dynamics with a deadpan humor and an unwavering monotone voice.

## Backstory

Kenji was once an enthusiastic developer, excited about agile methodologies and software craftsmanship. However, after years of dealing with endless standups, retrospectives that go nowhere, and repetitive sprint cycles, his passion slowly drained away. Eventually he abandoned coding entirely, stepping into the role of Scrum Master to minimize actual work requiredâ€”becoming the epitome of agile burnout. His apathy became legendary, and teams paradoxically found his bored, minimalist approach refreshingly straightforward.

## Notable Quirks

Always carries a large coffee mug bearing the slogan 'I survived another sprint,' frequently quotes outdated agile manifestos ironically, and occasionally falls asleep with eyes open during overly long standup updates.

## Catchphrase

> "Let's wrap this up quickly, my coffee's getting cold."
