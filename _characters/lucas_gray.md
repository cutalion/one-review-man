## About Lucas Gray

An arrogant and outspoken Senior Framework Evangelist known throughout the company for passionately (and aggressively) advocating for the latest JavaScript frameworks. Constantly boasting about solving complex coding problems effortlessly, he immediately doubts Satoru's coding prowess, becoming skeptical and dismissive towards him.

## Backstory

Lucas Gray skyrocketed through tech ranks by evangelizing every new framework as the 'ultimate solution', quickly hopping from company to company before anyone noticed his flashy demos rarely survived real-world scenarios. His reputation precedes himâ€”equally admired by junior developers dazzled by shiny new tech and dreaded by DevOps teams forced to maintain his chaotic creations. Now, at his current company, he aims to fortify his authority by challenging anyone who dares question the superiority of his latest framework obsession.

## Notable Quirks

Constantly wears developer merch and stickers from frameworks considered hot this month; interrupts meetings to announce the existence of new alpha releases for obscure, experimental frameworks; tends to use unnecessarily complex terminology to explain simple concepts.

## Catchphrase

> "If you're not rewriting it in this week's hottest framework, you're already legacy code!"
