## About Frontend Wizard

A sarcastic frontend developer known throughout programming circles for his sharp wit, quick comebacks, and cynical yet hilarious perspective on web development.

## Backstory

Once an optimistic junior developer, Kai became the Frontend Wizard after years of battling absurdly vague client demands, endless browser compatibility nightmares, and mind-numbing CSS battles. His cynical persona developed naturally as a coping mechanism, earning him legendary status among both junior devs needing guidance and senior devs needing comic relief.

## Notable Quirks

Always wears headphones even when not listening to anything, habitually sighs deeply before typing out code, and constantly debates the merits of tabs versus spaces to anyone willing (or unwilling) to listen.

## Catchphrase

> "Looks fine on my screen."
