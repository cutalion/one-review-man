## About Kenji Yamamoto

A casually dressed programmer known for effortlessly writing flawless code, to the point that his submissions are always merged after a single review. He is bored and unchallenged by his own perfection, seeking excitement in the mundane.

## Backstory

Once an ordinary junior developer burdened by endless bugs and code reviews, Satoru undertook a rigorous training regimen: he read Stack Overflow answers for 100 days straight, refactored legacy code without sleep, and debugged assembly for a month. Unexpectedly, this granted him programming perfection, making every challenge trivial and every bug easily solvableâ€”leaving him bored and unfulfilled by his incredible skills.

## Notable Quirks

Frequently sighs heavily after submitting code, hoping desperately for someone to critique his perfect solutions.

## Catchphrase

> "Another perfect review... how boring."
