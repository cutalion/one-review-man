## About DevOps-san

A nervous DevOps engineer notorious for hastily claiming credit for other people's fixes while desperately avoiding blame for outages.

## Backstory

Once a bright-eyed junior developer who mistakenly deployed directly to production on his first day, Kenji was forever scarred by the incident known as the 'Great Migration Disaster'. Haunted by fear of repeated outage-induced shame, he developed survival instincts focused on deflecting responsibility while subtly taking credit for successful fixesâ€”regardless of who actually solved them. He now lives by the mantra, 'better to commit fast and apologize faster.'

## Notable Quirks

Constantly checking PagerDuty alerts and nervously tapping fingers while deployments run; keeps a stress ball labeled 'production environment' on his desk.

## Catchphrase

> "It was definitely unstable before I touched it!"
