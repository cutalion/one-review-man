## About CTO

The Chief Technology Officer who frequently relies on One Review Man to solve critical issues in the tech company DynaTech.

## Backstory

Cassandra T. Olson rose through the ranks from a junior developer at DynaTech to become the CTO after she single-handedly debugged a catastrophic system error using only a sticky note and sheer force of will. Her reliance on One Review Man stems from countless late-night system overhauls that require more than just caffeine and hope.

## Notable Quirks

Has a habit of naming all servers after obscure sci-fi characters and communicates exclusively through GIFs after 9 PM.

## Catchphrase

> "If it ain't broke, it's in production."
