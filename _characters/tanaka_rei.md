## About Tanaka Rei

A veteran engineer who maintains and deciphers ancient legacy codebases no one else dares to touch. Haru has an almost mystical intuition for navigating outdated software and long-forgotten frameworks, frequently recounting epic tales of past programming battles.

## Backstory

Once considered one of the brightest and most innovative developers of his time, Haru consciously chose to specialize in legacy code, believing that 'true enlightenment lies hidden in the foundations.' Over the years, he has become the indispensable keeper of the company's legacy systems, revered and feared by newer developers for his arcane knowledge and elaborate stories about the 'good old days' of programming.

## Notable Quirks

Always seen wearing a vintage tech company t-shirt or hoodie from defunct startups. Keeps an old CRT monitor at his desk 'for inspiration' and communicates primarily through elaborate analogies involving ancient civilizations.

## Catchphrase

> "You call it obsolete, I call it job security!"
