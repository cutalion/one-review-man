## About Scrum Master Sato

A strict, no-nonsense team lead obsessed with Agile practices and Jira boards, known for his meticulous planning and legendary stand-up meetings.

## Backstory

Formerly a carefree junior developer, Kenji Sato experienced a traumatic project delay early in his career caused by poor task management. Vowing never to repeat this disaster, he transformed into Scrum Master Satoâ€”sworn protector of sprint cycles and vigilant keeper of Jira tickets. He now roams the tech landscape enforcing Agile discipline on unsuspecting developers.

## Notable Quirks

Always carries a deck of planning poker cards, has an irrational fear of tasks labeled 'Miscellaneous', and insists on using 'story points' as a unit of measure even in unrelated tasks.

## Catchphrase

> "If it's not in Jira, it doesn't exist!"
