## About Tom Richards

A skeptical senior developer specializing in backend infrastructure, always questioning anything that's newer than five years old. Advocates passionately for traditional refactoring, microservices, and rigorous code reviews. He distrusts flashy frameworks and trendy tech stacks, considering them dangerous distractions from proven methodologies.

## Backstory

Once a rising star fascinated by shiny new technologies, Tom experienced a catastrophic outage caused by the premature adoption of an unstable JavaScript framework. Scarred by the incident and the endless blame-filled retrospectives that followed, he swore to never again trust trendy tech. Now he patrols the backend landscape, tirelessly advocating caution, stability, and thorough code reviews. Despite his tough stance, Tom secretly admires Satoru (One Review Man) for his immaculate, bug-free pull requests, although he maintains a skeptical demeanor to save face.

## Notable Quirks

Always carries a vintage pager on his belt, claiming it's more reliable than Slack or email. Often quotes obscure passages from the 'Gang of Four' design patterns book during code reviews.

## Catchphrase

> "If it's not battle-tested, it's not going into production."
