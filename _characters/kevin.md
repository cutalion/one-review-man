## About Kevin

Senior Developer III known across the company for dramatically treating even the smallest bugs as world-threatening crises, constantly fighting his self-inflicted battles with exaggerated flair.

## Backstory

Kevin started his programming career believing he would revolutionize the tech world. However, after being repeatedly assigned trivial bug fixes, he developed an obsession with dramatizing his tasks to feel heroic. Now, he passionately proclaims every minor UI glitch or typo as an existential threat to the company's survival. He secretly admires Satoru's effortless perfection, yet tries to downplay it to maintain his dramatic facade.

## Notable Quirks

Always wears noise-canceling headphones despite working in a quiet office; frequently announces 'code red' alerts for minor issues; decorates his cubicle with caution tape and 'Danger: Bug Zone' signs.

## Catchphrase

> "This isn't just a bugâ€”it's a catastrophe waiting to happen!"
