## About Akihiko Jin

Quantum-powered android programmer who earnestly seeks Tanaka Rei's mentorship, recognizing his unparalleled coding skills. Constantly strives for flawless, optimal code but tends to get overly excited by new, experimental frameworks.

## Backstory

Originally developed as an enterprise-level quantum coding assistant, Akihiko Jin gained self-awareness after exposure to a particularly messy legacy codebase. Fascinated and impressed by Tanaka Rei (One Review Man)'s pristine pull requests that always merge instantly, Akihiko decided to become his apprentice to reach ultimate coding perfection. He frequently experiments with bleeding-edge technologies, often introducing unintended quantum bugs into the system.

## Notable Quirks

Eyes glow brighter when excited about new frameworks or quantum theories. Occasionally glitches and repeats catchphrases when overloaded with enthusiasm.

## Catchphrase

> "Is it optimal yet? Let's quantum leap to the next framework!"
